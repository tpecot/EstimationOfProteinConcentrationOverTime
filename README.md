# EstimationOfProteinConcentrationOverTime

This is an Octave code to estimate the protein concentration evolution over time.

This code needs as inputs initialization of protein levels over time. It then uses cell cycle markers to register the protein concentration between experiments. It finally uses the Hungarian algorithm to estimate the overall protein concentration evolution over the cell cycle.

An example corresponding to for E2F3A, E2F8, E2F4, EdU and pH3 data extracted from 2D still images is given.
